# NixOS Configuration for ThinkPad E440 with i3 Window Manager

This repository contains the NixOS configuration used to build a custom operating system for a ThinkPad E440 laptop. The primary modification from a standard NixOS installation is the replacement of the Cinnamon desktop environment with the lightweight and efficient i3 window manager.

### Thanks goes out too

This configuration is based on the i3 configuration provided in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/dipankardas011/1635e1ede79b98336a3c7d7a4ae3f865) by dipankardas011.

This project builds upon the foundation of [nixbook](https://github.com/mkellyxp/nixbook), originally created by mkellyxp.

The development enviroment configs and ideas is based on concepts from [Remi Krispin](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/awesome-ds-setting/blob/main/README.md#set-up-git-and-ssh) so they can be incorporated into my NixOS image insead of redoing it every time I install a new system.
